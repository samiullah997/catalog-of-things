# Catalogue of things

> We created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but you will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
